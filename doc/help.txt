Remote .ssh management
======================

by default sshgui show 'yourself'@localhost, which means that it
manage the current user .ssh directory.

you may manage other user and host by entering :
anotherUser@anotherHost in the form.

BUT, for that to work you must have your public key in the
remote user authorized_keys file.

This is a chicken and egg problem, since you can not do
that with this software, it has to be done manually.

however, once done, you shoud be able to manage other ssh capabilites :
new keys, config, known_host, or even authorized_keys for another user
